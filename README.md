I spend most of my time building little experiments with JavaScript, styling everything with CSS, and keeping things clean with HTML.

 What I’m into

writing code that feels smooth 

playing around with animations, colors, and tiny UI details

learning new tricks in JS just for fun

creating projects that look small but have a lot going on inside

🌱 Currently

Working on random ideas, upgrading old code.

🎧 vibe

Coding with lo-fi on, hoodie up, thinking “ერთი პატარა ფუნქცია კიდე…” and then coding for 3 more hours.
